About
======  
I am a PhD student in computer vision and machine learning at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/), advised by professor Dr. [Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/). I hold an MSc degree in [computer science](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en) from the University of Bonn, and a BSc in computer and software engineering from the Technion.


Research interests
======
Human pose estimation, Weakly supervised and semi-supervised learning, Optimization in CNNs using constraints, Ordinal Prediction for sets, Semantic segmentation, Tracking, Optical flow, Scene flow, Generative Adversarial models, Robustness against adversarial attacks, Learning representations, Bias elimination in computer vision algorithms.
