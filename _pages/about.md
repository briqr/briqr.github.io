About
======  
I am a PhD student in computer science at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/), advised by professor Dr. [Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/). I hold an MSc degree in computer science from the University of Bonn, and a BSc in computer and software engineering from the Technion. Currently, I am interning at Amazon where my work focuses on computer vision technolonies for [Amazon Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc). 


Research interests
======
Human pose estimation, Weakly supervised and semi-supervised learning, Optimization in CNNs using constraints, Ordinal prediction for sets, Semantic segmentation, Tracking, Optical flow, Scene flow, Generative adversarial models, Robustness against adversarial attacks, Representation learning, Bias elimination in computer vision algorithms.
