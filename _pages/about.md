Hi there! I am a doctoral student in machine learning and computer vision at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/), since December 2017. My advisor is professor [Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/). I hold a Masters degree in computer science from the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/), and a BSc in computer and software engineering from the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en).
During my masters, I worked as a student research assistant in machine learning at [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/). I was respoinsible for developing the machine learning algirhtms for the [Ferari] EU-funded project ((http://www.ferari-project.eu/asset-open-software-repository-and-distributed-online-learning-framework/).
