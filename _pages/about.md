About
======  
Nov 2023-Present: **Scientific researcher** at the Applied machine learning lab, part of the HELMHOLTZ AI team headed by Dr. Stefan Kesselheim, Juelich Supercomputing Center.

Dec 2017-Aug 2019, Feb 2021-Aug 2022, Aug 2022-March 2023. **PhD** student in computer science, computer vision.

During these dates I worked as a PhD student in computer science at the University of Bonn. Since April 2023 I am self-funded, and I continue to work on my PhD part-time alongside working as a course instructor for undergrad CS courses (AI, Computer Graphics, Data Structures and Algorithms).

**MSc** in computer science, University of Bonn.

**BSc** in computer and software engineering, Technion. 


Research interests
======
Human pose estimation, Weakly supervised and semi-supervised learning, Optimization in CNNs using constraints, Ordinal prediction for sets, Semantic segmentation, Tracking, Optical flow, Scene flow, Generative adversarial models, Robustness against adversarial attacks, Representation learning, Bias elimination in computer vision algorithms. 


Research internships:
======
Applied scientist intern at Amazon Go, August 2021-August 2022. My work focused on synthesizing conditional human motion data.

Research intern at Facebook Reality Labs, August 2019-Jan 2020: I worked on differentiable rendering and optical flow for human body tracking.
