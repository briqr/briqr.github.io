About
======  
Nov 2023-Present: **Research scientist** at the Applied machine learning lab of HELMHOLTZ AI, Juelich Supercomputing Center. 
I am participating in the nxtaim project which is focused on building generative models for autonomous driving. 

Feb 2022-Present: **Course instructor** for undergrad CS courses (AI, Computer Graphics, Data Structures and Algorithms).

Dec 2017-Aug 2019, Feb 2021-Aug 2022, Aug 2022-Dec 2023. **PhD** student in computer science, computer vision, University of Bonn.

**MSc** in computer science, University of Bonn.

**BSc** in computer and software engineering, Technion. 

Research internships:
======
**Applied scientist intern** at Amazon Go, August 2021-August 2022. My work focused on synthesizing conditional human motion data.

**Research intern** at Facebook Reality Labs, August 2019-Jan 2020: I worked on differentiable rendering and optical flow for human body tracking. 

Research interests
======
During my PhD, I worked on 
- Weakly supervised semantic segmentation using constraints
- Human Pose estimation and dabbled with ordinal prediction for sets in the process
- Optical flow and scene flow for human body tracking during my internship at Facebook Reality Labs
- Generating human poses conditioned on text
- Generating human motion conditioned on multiple actions while internting at Amazon, followed up by scene constrained generation. 
  

Master's thesis
======
Online Robust Learning Using the Radon (center) Point. I proposed a method for aggregating multiple models that are trained independently using multiple data streams in a federated learning setting. Earlier works rely on simply averaging the models using the arithmetic mean, which fails when the data is noisy. The proposed method achieved superior error bounds both in theory and practice in the presence of outliers in the training data.
