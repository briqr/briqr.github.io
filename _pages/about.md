Hi there! I am a doctoral student in machine learning and computer vision at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/). I started my PhD in December 2017, where I am supervised by professor [Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/). I hold a Masters degree in computer science from the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/), and a BSc in computer and software engineering from the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en).

During my masters, I worked as a student research assistant in machine learning in the [Ferari project](https://www.ferari-project.eu/asset-open-software-repository-and-distributed-online-learning-framework/), at [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/).
