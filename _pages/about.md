About
======  
I am a PhD student in computer science at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/), advised by professor Dr. [Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/). I hold an MSc degree in computer science from the University of Bonn, and a BSc in computer and software engineering from the Technion.


Research interests
======
Human pose estimation, Weakly supervised and semi-supervised learning, Optimization in CNNs using constraints, Ordinal prediction for sets, Semantic segmentation, Tracking, Optical flow, Scene flow, Generative adversarial models, Robustness against adversarial attacks, Representation learning, Bias elimination in computer vision algorithms. 


Research internships:
======
Applied scientist intern at Amazon Go, August 2021-August 2022. My work focused on synthesizing conditional human motion data.

Research intern Facebook Reality Labs, August 2019-Jan 2020: I worked on differentiable rendering and optical flow for human body tracking.
