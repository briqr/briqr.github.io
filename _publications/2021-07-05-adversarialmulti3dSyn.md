title: "Towards Better Adversarial Synthesis of Human Images from Text"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This paper proposes an approach that generates multiple 3D human meshes from text. The human shapes are represented by 3D meshes based on the SMPL model. The model performance is evaluated on the COCO dataset, which contains challenging human shapes and intricate interactions between individuals. The model is able to capture the dynamics of the scene and the interactions between individuals based on text. We further show how using such a shape as input to image synthesis frameworks helps to constrain the network to synthesize humans with realistic human shapes.'
