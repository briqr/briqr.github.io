title: "Unifying Part Detection and Association for Recurrent Multi-Person Pose Estimation"
collection: publications
excerpt: '	Bottom-up approaches for 2D multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) detect joints collectively without distinguishing individuals. Associating the joints to individuals is not part of the learning algorithm and is performed in a post-processing step that relies on sophisticated heuristics. We propose a learning-based model that performs joint detection and association simultaneously, thereby eliminating the need for further post-processing. The approach consists of two stages, in the first stage low-level features are extracted, and in the second stage we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) which takes the low-level features as input and predicts the heatmaps of a single person's joints in each iteration. In addition, the network learns a stopping criterion in order to halt once it has identified all individuals in an image. Our approach is generic and can be combined with any bottom-up approach. We evaluate our model on the challenging MSCOCO and OCHuman datasets and obtain an improvement over the baseline, in which association is heuristic-based and and takes no part in the learning. On OCHuman, which contains severe occlusions, we achieve state-of-the-art results even compared to top-down approaches. Our results demonstrate the advantage of a learning-based detection and association framework, and bottom-up approaches over top-down approaches in challenging scenarios.'
