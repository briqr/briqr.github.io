excerpt: 'Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has been a subject of increased interest due to the scarcity of fully annotated images. We introduce a new optimization approach for solving weakly supervised semantic segmentation with deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). The method introduces a novel layer which applies simplex projection on the
output of a neural network using area constraints of class objects. The proposed method
is general and can be seamlessly integrated into any CNN architecture. Moreover, the
projection layer allows strongly supervised models to be adapted to weakly supervised
models effortlessly by substituting ground truth labels. Our experiments have shown that
applying such an operation on the output of a CNN substantially improves the accuracy of the baseline architecture and allows for faster convergence.'
